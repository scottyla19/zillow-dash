# Change Log for dash-table-experiments
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 0.6.0 - 2018-02-21
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `min_height` not expanding if `len(rows)` was greater than 10.
- Fixed issues with `row_height` property

### Added
- `max_rows_in_viewport` to expand the viewport up to `max_rows_in_viewport` rows.

To summarize the height behaviour:
- By default, up to 10 rows are displayed. If only 5 rows are supplied, only 5 rows will be displayed and the viewport will shrink. If 15 rows are supplied, 10 rows are displayed.
- If `max_rows_in_viewport` is supplied, up to `max_rows_in_viewport` will be displayed. This is `10` by default. So, if `max_rows_in_viewport` is 20 and 5 rows are supplied, only 5 rows will be displayed and the viewport will shrink. If 25 rows are supplied, only 20 rows will be displayed.
- If `min_height` is supplied, the viewport will be resized to `min_height` regardless of the number of rows that are supplied.
- If `max_rows_in_viewport` is supplied _and_ `min_height` is supplied, `max_rows_in_viewport` takes precedence.

## 0.5.4
### Fixed
- Fixed issue with `min_height` regarding the `DataTable` under 10 rows.
- Fixed issue with `filter` bar under 2 rows. Before, if there was only one row of data and the user clicked on 'Filter' the data would disappear. To improve the UI, if there is only one row additional height is added to the table div element so the user can still see the data if the 'Filter' button is selected.

## 0.5.3
### Added
- A `resizable` property on the `DataTable` component. If `True`, then the columns
can be resized by clicking and dragging on the border on the edge of the column
header. If `False`, they cannot be resized. By default, columns are resizable.

## 0.5.2
### Added
- A `column_widths` property can be used to set the column widths of the
`DataTable`. Simple example:
```python
ROWS = [
    {'a': 'AA', 'b': 1},
    {'a': 'AB', 'b': 2},
]

dt.DataTable(
    rows=ROWS,
    columns=['a', 'b'],
    column_widths=[200, 400]
)
```

## 0.5.1
### Added
- `DataTable` now automatically resizes to fit data that has less than 10 rows.

## 0.5.0
### Added
- `filterable=True`, `sortable=True`, and `row_selectable=True` all work well with each other
